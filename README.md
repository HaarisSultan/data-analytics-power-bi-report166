# Project description

... 

In the first part of the project, I import data into Power BI in several ways: by connecting to an Azure SQL Database; via a downloaded csv file; from Azure Blob storage; combining several csv files from a folder. I made changes to the format and contents of the data using a variety of transformation's; for example by creating Column's From Examples, as well as splitting, renaming and removing columns.
